# NLP Course Exercises - University of Kurdistan

This repository contains exercises designed for students in the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course at the University of Kurdistan, taught by Dr. Fatemeh Daneshfar.

### Purpose
The exercises aim to:
- Help students understand real-world applications of NLP.
- Emphasize the importance of visualizing NLP outputs for better comprehension.

### Contents

1. **Exercise 3: TF-IDF**  
   - Introduces students to **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**.
   - Students will compute TF-IDF scores for terms in a corpus using Python libraries like `scikit-learn`.

2. **Exercise 4: CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**  
   - Focuses on the **CBOW model**, a neural network-based approach for word embeddings.
   - Students will implement CBOW using Python and visualize the embeddings.

### Instructions given to students
- **Programming Language**: Python is preferred for coding solutions.
- **Dataset**: Use the datasets provided within the instructions of each exercise.
- **Tools**: Students can use platforms like Google Colab for code execution and visualization.
- **Submission**: Submit the exercises as `.py` or `.ipynb` files, accompanied by a PDF report.
